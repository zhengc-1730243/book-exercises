# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library("nycflights13")
library("dplyr")

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
View(flights)
dep_delay_by_month <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
  
# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?

most_delay_month <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(mean_dep_delay == max(mean_dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(month)
  
# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
plot(dep_delay_by_month)

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows

higest_arrival_delay <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(- avg_arr_delay) %>% 
  head(3)

# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!
View(airports)

# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
highest_speed_city <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(avg_speed = mean(distance/air_time, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(avg_speed == max(avg_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(dest)
